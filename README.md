# Running and developing
To run the application for the first time and getting ready for development you have to run this command once:

This will download all required dependencies and thus may take a long time.
Once it's finished the application will boot up and you can access it via you webbrowser by the links shown in the

and then importing it via eclipse -> import -> Import existing project.
