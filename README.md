# bicycle-tracking ![build status](https://travis-ci.org/Hawai-AST/bicycle-tracking-frontend.svg?branch=master)
An application which tracks bicycle GPS data in order to provide services for customers

# Running and developing
To run the application for the first time and getting ready for development you have to run this command once:
```
activator run
```
This will download all required dependencies and thus may take a long time.
Once it's finished the application will boot up and you can access it via your web browser by the links shown in the
output.

To start developing, you can generate a eclipse project by running
```
activator eclipse
```
and then importing it via eclipse -> import -> Import existing project.
